# Responsive CSS with Sass and Compass

I have gain knowledge about Sass and Compass by watching Lynda tutorials to help me enhance my skills in front and
back end web development. With Sass and Compass you can simplfy the way you right rules for your code. In this mini project, I 
have used Grunt JS for efficient workflow. This help me automate the process of combining and compressing my JavaScript and CSS 
files. Grunt JS also helps to create an easy workflow in a team enviroment. 

In this project I have learned about Mobile first approach for the layout of the pages. Then I have learned how to create
modules and partials for Sass. Also I learned how to use variables to create a color pallet and control Sass functions and 
Compass mixins in the code. Finally I learned how to created mobile first responsive grid with Susy framework, which sit on
top of Compass and gives an easier way to create responsive code without having to add extra Markup to the HTML.
